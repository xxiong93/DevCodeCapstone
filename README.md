# DevCodeCapstone

# This is my capstone project for the devCodeCamp program.  It uses the MERN stack, Javascript, and the National Park Service and Google Maps API's for data integration and map search functionality. This program is intended to let the user created a simple trip to multiple national parks in the US utilizing MongoDB as a database to store user credentials and trip information.  It is still a work in progress.  The two API's incorporated into the program are working as intended but is still pending in terms of my full vision of this project.
